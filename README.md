# PPG-Project
This project involves using making and IoT pulse monitor system, comprising of a wearable device (ESP32) that communicates in real-time via bluetooth with a host computer app (Python).
A PPG sensor readings will make an LED light up in sync with the heart beat, and also be used to calculate heart rate. The raw data and heart rate are constantly being sent over to a host computer app.
The host computer app comprises of a GUI that plots the data with the option to record it, as well as have alarms for abnormal heart rates.
